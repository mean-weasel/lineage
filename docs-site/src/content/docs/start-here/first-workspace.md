title: Create your first workspace
description: Focus a project and root asset in a reusable workspace for review, branching, and continuation.

## What this does

A workspace records the part of a project you are actively exploring. It keeps
the selected root, view state, and handoff context available without changing
the underlying asset history.

## Step-by-step workflow

1. Open **Lineage** and choose a project.
2. Select **New workspace**.
3. Choose a root asset and give the workspace a recognizable name.
4. Review the visible descendants and current attempts.
5. Select the asset or assets that should drive the next variation.
6. Use the handoff panel when another agent session should continue the work.

## Behind the scenes

Projects own assets; workspaces point into projects. Creating or changing a
workspace does not duplicate media and does not rewrite lineage relationships.

See [Projects, workspaces, and assets](../concepts/projects-workspaces-assets)
for the full mental model.
